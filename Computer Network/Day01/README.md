## **`Client server architecture`**

### Types of Client-Server Architecture

-   **1-Tier architecture**  
    ğŸ‘‰ Everything in one place, that means the presentation (what you see), the application (the software), and the data (the information) all reside on the same system.  
    ğŸ‘‰ A standalone desktop application with a local database.

-   **2-Tier architecture**  
    ğŸ‘‰ The presentation (front end) and application (business logic) handled by the client.  
    ğŸ‘‰ The database is the separated entity.  
    ğŸ‘‰ A desktop app like a library management system, where the app runs on your computer and connects to a central database server.

-   **3-Tier architecture**  
    ğŸ‘‰ Client is only responsible for presentation layer (frontend). Client are not bound with the remaining parts  
    ğŸ‘‰ Application layer or **middleware** responsible for handling business logic for the processing requests between the client and the database.  
    ğŸ‘‰ Data layer which stores and retrieves data from the database.  
    ğŸ‘‰ Most modern web applications. Your browser (client) interacts with a web server (application server), which then interacts with a database server to retrieve and store information.
