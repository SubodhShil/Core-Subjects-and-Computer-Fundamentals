## Class

Classes are just like the molding of an actual product. For example, the picture described below is a molding of creating cakes. So, we molded and put various ingredients into different types of cakes. But the molding gives the actual shape.

> Just like cake molding, **a class is a blueprint for an entity**. Entities are actual, real-life representations that a class is capable of producing.

-   Here is one thing - the shape of the cake is always the same. But we can have different flavors, which the mold doesn't care about. We can prepare chocolate cake, vanilla cake, or strawberry cake, which is totally up to you. So, properties are not strictly prohibited or maintained by the class itself; the maker of a product or object can tweak around his product or property.
