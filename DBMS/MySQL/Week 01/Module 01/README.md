## Database

Database is a solution for keeping data organize in a central place. Database plays important role when it comes to convert data into information.

-   Keep
-   Manage
-   Retrieve

### Some types of database

1. **Relational database**: It is possible to establish relation between two database table as they share common attribute.
2. **Non relational database**: Has no relation between two table.
3. Graph database
4. Centralized database:
5. Cloud database
6. Distributed database: Database has multiple location to distrubute traffic.

## `MySQL`

It's a **Relational Database Management System** (RDBMS) and where data are arranged in tabular form.

1. **Field**: The table column is called a field.
2. **Value**: Each cell of a field that represents some data, is a value
3. **Record**: A row is called a record, consists of multiple fields.

## `DBMS and RDBMS`

DBMS => Database Management System  
RDBMS => Relational Database Management System

Here **system** refers to a software that used for managing databases.

Advantages:

1. Data is safe in a database.
2. Organized way to manage and retrive data.
3. CRUD operation.
4. Processing on data can be automated.
5. Fast data access.
6. Parallel acessing: Multiple data access can be done at a time.

**Primary key**: A primary key is an unique value belong to a
field (unique field), that is used for accessing other field value on the same record or row of a table.

**Composite Primary Key**: A composite key consists of two or more field values to uniquely identify value or data from the same record.

**Foreign Key**: A key is said to be a foreign key if it is primary key of a table and act as a field of other tables. Foreign key establish relationship between multiple tables.

Types of relation:

1. One to one
