> DBMS is a software that provides convenient ways to create, read/retrieve, update or delete data by manipulating databases.   
> RDBMS is a special type of DBMS that stores relational or tabular data. RDBMS stores data in structural tables (using rows and columns).

-   SQL is a language for managing and querying data.

### **What is a record?**

### **What is concurrency in database?**

ðŸ‘‰ Simultaneous execution or manipulation of data by several processes or user without resulting in data inconsistency.

ðŸ‘‰ A schemaless, flexible database capable of storing unstructured data.

## Records (Rows)
